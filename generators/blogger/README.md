Blogger
-------

Blogger has a "Javascript required" mode called "Dynamic Views".

This bookmarklet configuration implements something similar 
but using progressive-enhancement over the top of a "normal" Blogger site.
This means the content is still available if Javascript fails for any reason.

This is still under development and can only be viewed (if working) at
