Supported generators
--------------------

Most generators of web documentation-sets rely on framesets or frames. 
These typically have primary content in a frame, with banner, navigation, etc
in the top window or in other frames.

This site design is actually a good indication that the desire for
a content-first approach has been around for a long time.
The downfall of doing this with frames is the lack of flexibility
with regards to layout and, especially, the inability to easily bookmark or hyperlink to individual pages. 

**meeko-panner** allows these sites to be bookmarkable by assuming the
primary content is in the top window and adding the banner and navigation
into the same window with AJAX.
