MadCap Flare Mobile WebHelp
===========================

Flare's Mobile WebHelp consists of navigation pages seperate to topic pages. It works fine with Javascript disabled and on small devices. 

**meeko-panner** progressively-enhances these documentation sets with a UI that resembles Flare's default HTML5 output (but with the bonus that the URL in the address bar always matches the topic content).
