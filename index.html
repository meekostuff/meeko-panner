<div id="__main__" role="main"><p><strong>meeko-panner</strong> is a javascript bookmarklet that can enhance a site with 
support for <code>pushState</code>-assisted-navigation (panning)
and, optionally, a richer UI. </p>

<p>The intention is to demonstrate the simplicity and flexibility of
a <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4523/">content first</a> approach for web-sites.</p>

<p><strong>meeko-panner</strong> extracts only the essential content of each page and 
uses <a href="http://github.com/meekostuff/HTMLDecor">HTMLDecor</a> to 
decorate it with shared site decor -
banner, navigation, auxilliary content, styles and layout.
In general this is used to emulate the original appearance and behavior of the site,
except with panning support. 
Another scenario is that a mobile site is enhanced with the appearance of the standard site. 
I consider it obvious that this approach would have better performance and flexibility
if integrated into a site rather than being implemented as a JS bookmarklet. </p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>You need a browser with javascript support enabled. <script type="text/javascript">document.write("Your browser DOES")</script><noscript>Your browser DOES NOT</noscript>  </p>

<p>You need a browser that implements <code>history.pushState()</code>. <script type="text/javascript">document.write("Your browser ", !!history.pushState ? "DOES" : "DOES NOT")</script><br /></p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> HTMLDecor doesn't require <code>pushState</code> if integrated into a site,
but to use it in a bookmarklet would require the bookmarklet to be run on every page. </p>

<p>The following browsers have been tested:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome 23</li>
<li>Safari 5.1 / Webkit nightlies</li>
<li>Firefox 17</li>
</ul>

<p>IE10 supports <code>pushState</code> but has not been tested.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p><em>Be sure to read the <strong>Notes and Warnings</strong> section</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Drag the
<a href="javascript:var decorBase = (location.protocol == 'https:') ? 'https://d3g4qkktqnw71.cloudfront.net/meeko-panner/' : 'http://dist.meekostuff.net/meeko-panner/'; var script=document.createElement('script'); script.src=decorBase + 'loader.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); void(0);" title="meeko-panner">
meeko-panner</a> bookmarklet to your bookmark bar.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to a <a href="sites/">supported site</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Click on the meeko-panner bookmarklet you just installed. </p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes and Warnings</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>This is a minimally tested and unsupported project. Use at your own risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Features may not work or break without warning. </p></li>
<li><p>Some sites send different markup to different users, depending on device, region, etc.
So this may not work at all for you even with the browsers I have tested. </p></li>
<li><p>Having said that, if something fails you can usually just refresh the page (and run meeko-panner again).</p></li>
<li><p>The speed of <strong>meeko-panner</strong> is limited primarily by the site it is running on. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
<li>separate XBL into its own project</li>
</ul>
