<div id="__main__" role="main"><h2>adactio.com</h2>

<p>This is a personal site with each page containing primary content
plus some combination of various auxiliary panels.</p>

<p>The author - Jeremy Keith - is an advacate for responsive design,
responsive content and progressive enhancement.
It seemed appropriate for this to be the first blog-style site
to receive the meeko-panner treatment.</p>

<p>The only complication in enhancing this site is showing and hiding auxiliary
panels depending on what section of the site the current page belongs to. </p>

<p>meeko-panner is configured for the <a href="http://adactio.com/">whole site</a></p>
