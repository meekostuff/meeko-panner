This is a personal site with each page containing primary content
plus some combination of various auxiliary panels.

The author - Jeremy Keith - is an advacate for responsive design,
responsive content and progressive enhancement.
It seemed appropriate for this to be the first blog-style site
to receive the meeko-panner treatment.

The only complication in enhancing this site is showing and hiding auxiliary
panels depending on what section of the site the current page belongs to. 

meeko-panner is configured for the [whole site](http://adactio.com/)
