api.jquery.com
--------------

This is the API reference site for jQuery. 

Every page contains the primary content - which is specific to the URL - and auxiliary content - banner, navigation, etc.
Enhancing the site is trivial since every page has the same auxiliary content and layout. 

meeko-panner is configured for the [whole site](http://api.jquery.com/).
