<div id="__main__" role="main"><h2>api.jquery.com</h2>

<p>This is the API reference site for jQuery. </p>

<p>Every page contains the primary content - which is specific to the URL - and auxiliary content - banner, navigation, etc.
Enhancing the site is trivial since every page has the same auxiliary content and layout. </p>

<p>meeko-panner is configured for the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/">whole site</a>.</p>
